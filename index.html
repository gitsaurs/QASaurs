  // ‚úÖ PART 1: Root Problem ‚Äì Mismatched Documents
  {
    q: "What happens when PAN card belongs to the buyer but other KYC documents are from a blood relation?",
    a: "FASTag registration gets flagged as fraudulent KYC by the issuing bank. It violates RBI KYC norms. The FASTag is blocked permanently or held in pending-KYC review."
  },
  {
    q: "Can blood relative documents be used for FASTag KYC under any circumstances?",
    a: "Only if there‚Äôs an official joint ownership declaration (affidavit, legal PoA, etc.). Otherwise, all documents must belong to the registered owner."
  },
  {
    q: "What is the correction process if mismatched KYC has already been submitted?",
    a: "Request tag cancellation ‚Üí Reapply using correct owner's documents ‚Üí Submit self-attested copies ‚Üí Attach explanation letter with dealership seal if required by bank."
  },

  // üö´ PART 2: Portal Blocked ‚Äì Dealership ID Frozen
  {
    q: "What causes a FASTag dealer ID to get blocked on the bank portal?",
    a: "High rejection rate, suspicious KYC patterns, repeated mismatches, or exceeding daily tag issuance without validation."
  },
  {
    q: "How to immediately recover dealership FASTag portal access?",
    a: "Write to the FASTag nodal officer with incident details and corrective steps. CC sales head and bank distributor. Follow up via call."
  },
  {
    q: "Can alternate dealer IDs from another branch be used temporarily?",
    a: "Yes, if permitted by the bank, but GST and address must match in CRM and tax records."
  },
  {
    q: "What is a long-term fix to avoid repeated FASTag blocks?",
    a: "Implement internal KYC match system with a pre-upload checklist for PAN, Aadhaar, and RC."
  },
  {
    q: "What audit records should the RTO executive maintain?",
    a: "Maintain: Date/time of upload, verified KYC docs, verifier name, and FASTag ID/reference."
  },

  // üí∏ PART 3: Dealership Penalizing RTO Executive
  {
    q: "Is it legal for a dealership to deduct profit margin from an RTO executive due to process error?",
    a: "No. Unless stated in the appointment letter or HR policy, such deductions are unfair and can be challenged."
  },
  {
    q: "How to professionally respond to dealership imposing a penalty for FASTag ID blockage?",
    a: "Write a formal explanation including cause, corrective steps, training gaps, and request for internal inquiry."
  },
  {
    q: "What preventive SOP should RTO execs implement to avoid future penalties?",
    a: "Mandatory KYC checklist, CRM/WhatsApp logs, consultant-RTO signoff, and internal training records."
  },
  {
    q: "How to negotiate with dealership to waive imposed penalties?",
    a: "Offer to conduct team training, submit revised SOP, and take responsibility with a plan for no future errors."
  },
  {
    q: "Who to approach if dealership forces illegal fines?",
    a: "Escalate to HR ‚Üí corporate compliance ‚Üí external labor consultant ‚Üí or FASTag vendor to get cleared report."
  },

  // üõ°Ô∏è PART 4: Legal Safeguards
  {
    q: "What documentation should RTO executives keep as evidence?",
    a: "Keep KYC logs, WhatsApp warnings to sales, email records, and signed approval checklists."
  },
  {
    q: "Can dealership terminate RTO staff for a single FASTag error?",
    a: "No. Labor law requires proper inquiry, documentation, and chance to explain before termination."
  },
  {
    q: "What to include in an apology/justification letter to the management?",
    a: "Include: Incident Summary, Root Cause, Corrective Actions, Preventive Plan, and a respectful tone without taking full blame."
  },
  {
    q: "How to handle stress from dealership‚Äôs aggressive behavior?",
    a: "Document everything, speak to HR, and if stress persists, approach an HR counselor or labor legal advisor."
